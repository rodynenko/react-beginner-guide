# What's this
Roadmap / guide / starting points to undestanding and making great things with React.

# Motivation
There are a lot of great tutorials/courses/articles/collections of articles which can help you study React, and show how to make great things with it. But as a newbie to React ecosystem, it's hard to find where to start and what you need. So I believe, it will be a good basement for your discoveries in the React's world.

# Discover tree
Before reading futher I recommend to look into this [How-To](https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto). You can find stages of studying React there. In current guide you will find more detailizations, recommendations and what to read.
* React itself
  * Good start is to look through Facebook's original [Tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html#overview) and [Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html) (they are really great and contain important basics)
  * To test some features step by step you can on [Buildwithreact](http://buildwithreact.com/tutorial) or use [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io)
  * [React in patterns](https://krasimir.gitbooks.io/react-in-patterns/content/) this online-book covers main things you have to undestand with code samples.
* Redux
  * Redux itself:
    * [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) docs
  * Redux in React:
    * [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)
    * [Getting started with redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) short online course by Dan Abramov (one of React maintainers)
    * [Ducks modules](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) redux architecture proposition
  * useful Redux middlewares:
    * [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) use functions in action creaters
    * [redux-api-middleware](https://github.com/agraboso/redux-api-middleware) handle API request in Redux style
    * [redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org) if you prefer ES6 generators ;)
* MobX
  * [MobX](https://mobx.js.org) docs
  * [Awesome Mobx](https://github.com/mobxjs/awesome-mobx) huge collection of everything you have to know about MobX
* Routing
  * [SPA (Single page application) on Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) is a trigger to use routing in React apps
  * [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) most popular routing library
  * [HTML5 History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/History_API)
* Animation in React
  * [react-motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion) is a good-old way to add animation to your components
  * [react-spring](https://github.com/drcmda/react-spring)
  * [react-transition-group](http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group)
* Form handling
  * [redux-form](https://redux-form.com), in my opinion, is a good start to understand form handling in React and it is the oldest library of this kind.
  * [formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik) uses render-props technique under hood, and is smaller that previous one.
  * [final-form](https://github.com/final-form/final-form)
* Awesome collections of articles around React:
  * [React Redux links](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links )
  * [Awesome React](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react)
* Best practice
