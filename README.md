# What's this
Roadmap / guide / starting points to undestanding and making great things with React.

# Motivation
There are a lot of great tutorials/courses/articles/collections of articles which can help you study React, and show how to make great things with it. But as a newbie to React ecosystem, it's hard to find where to start and what you need. So I believe, it will be a good basement for your discoveries in the React's world.

# Discover tree
Before reading futher I recommend to look into this [How-To](https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto). You can find stages of studying React there. In current guide you will find more detailizations, recommendations and what to read.
